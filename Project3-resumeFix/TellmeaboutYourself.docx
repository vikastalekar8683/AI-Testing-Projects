Tell Me About Yourself (Structured & Professional – 1.5 to 2 Minutes)

Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity.

I am a Quality Engineering professional with over 13 years of experience in Manual and Automation Testing across web and API-based enterprise applications. Currently, I am working as an Associate Principal SDET at AFour Technologies, where I design and implement scalable automation frameworks using Selenium with Java and REST Assured.

Over the years, I have worked extensively in Agile environments, collaborating closely with developers, product owners, and operations teams within sprint-based delivery models. My primary focus has been ensuring high-quality, stable releases while supporting faster time-to-market goals.

I have built and integrated automation frameworks into Jenkins CI pipelines, enabling continuous testing and reducing regression effort by 30%. My experience includes functional testing, API validation, test strategy design, defect lifecycle management, and mentoring QA teams.

What differentiates me is my automation-first mindset combined with strong analytical skills. I focus not just on executing tests, but on improving processes, increasing test coverage, and preventing defects early in the lifecycle.

At this stage in my career, I am looking for an opportunity where I can contribute to a mature Agile DevOps setup, work on large-scale enterprise systems, and further strengthen my expertise in quality engineering and continuous delivery.
